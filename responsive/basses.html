                    <h2>Extended Range Bass Guitars</h2>
                    <p>Expanding the traditional range, 5 and 6 basses add a low B string and high C string respectivly, extending the instrument’s lower range and providing extra tonal options. These instruments are ideal for genres that require deeper or higher tones like jazz, metal, and progressive music. They also allow for more complex fingerings and chord progressions.</p>

                    <h2>Acoustic Bass Guitars</h2>
                    <p>Acoustic bass guitars are ideal for those who prefer a more natural sound without amplification. They are especially popular in unplugged or acoustic settings. One important thing to remember about acoustic bass guitars is that they are much quieter than regular acoustic guitars. If you are interested in playing with a group, you may want to consider finding an acousitc bass that includes a way to amplify it.</p>
